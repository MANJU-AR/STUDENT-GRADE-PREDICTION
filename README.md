# STUDENT-GRADE-PREDICTION
The Student Grade Predictor uses machine learning to estimate a studentâ€™s final grade based on study time, attendance, and previous exam scores. Built with a Random Forest model and a Flask web interface, it helps students and educators anticipate academic performance and make informed decisions.
